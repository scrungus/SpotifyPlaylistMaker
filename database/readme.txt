To run the virtual env on windows firstly run paste this into console:
Set-ExecutionPolicy -ExecutionPolicy RemoteSigned -Scope CurrentUser
then run the Activate.ps1 in the Scripts folder. This should make (python-virtual-environment) appear at the start of the command line
now. 
Make sure when you run a command you run it in this terminal

Not too sure on how to do it on linux but i assume its easier.
