Make sure you have python 3.9.x installed otherwise it will have a hissy fit
Now run this command to enable you to run these commands
Set-ExecutionPolicy -ExecutionPolicy RemoteSigned -Scope CurrentUser

In CMD go to the Scripts folder and run:
activate.bat
then your command line should look like this:
(python-virtual-environments)
now run install.bat in this new command line
this should install it all for you
