# Docker Guide
To get docker environment working, install docker and docker-compose. Make sure docker service is running on your machine. Then should just be a case of running 'docker-compose up --build' with admin permissions to build and deploy.
Get something like Kitematic if you want a management dashboard to view the docker images and networks.
